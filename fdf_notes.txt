Fdf means 'Fil de Fer' or 'Wire frame' in english and our goal will be to draw a map in relief. 
Thus it's a small cartography software that can be seen as Google maps but worse.
MinilibX enable us to create a window, to display pixels inside, to draw a pixel, to handle a few events.

So we have x and y coordinate system in which values such as 10 means an altitude of z coordinate in 3D map.

> cat maps/42.fdf
> make
>./fdf maps/42.fdf  // launch the 42 map

little graphical window
- change the altitude
- zoom, move inside
- bonus: rotations to turn the map, or fill this map with colors to give a small deep effect, handle hidden sides, 
change the color range, do an rainbow effect.

display a line: drawing line algorithm will be to draw lines in every direction and every orientation.
Bresenham algorithm in Wikipedia. The aim is to dram line from Point A to Point B on pixels.

Projections:
- isometric 
- parallel
- conical

MLX: the MinilibX!
Simple a small homemade library, which will allow you to open windows on the screen and make pretty drawings inside.
To allow you quickly access graphic projects.

- to open a window, 
- light a pixel and 
- deal with events linked to this window: keyboard and mouse

Several man of the MinilibX:
1) ~mlx: man /usr/share/man/man3/mlx.1 //what the MinilibX is about, how it works, define the include you have to put 
in your program. What is the first absolutely essential f-n that connects you to the Mac's graphical server: mlx_init ();
How you will be able to compile you MinilibX on MacOS.
2) ~mlx: man /usr/share/man/man3/mlx_new_window.1
3) ~mlx: man /usr/share/man/man3/mlx_pixel_put.1
4) ~mlx: man /usr/share/man/man3/mlx_loop.1


EXAMPLE.
~mlx: emacs -nw main.c
// we will open a window
#include "mlx.h"
int main() {
    void *mlx_ptr;
    void *win_ptr;

    mlx_ptr = mlx_init(); // returns a void*, it's just a connection login to the graphical server.
    win_ptr = mlx_new_window(mlx_ptr, 500, 500, "mlx 42");
    mlx_loop(mlx_ptr);
}

// complile all this
~mlx: cc -I /usr/local/include main.c -L /usr/local/lib/ -lmlx -framework OpenGL -framework AppKit
// execute
~mlx: ./a.out
// the window opens on the screen!

====================================================================================================
Management of the events.
The events are when the user will use the keyboard or the mouse and you will be able to retrieve the info in your program.


EXAMPLE.
~mlx: emacs -nw main.c
// we will open a window
#include <unistd.h>
#include "mlx.h"

int ft_putchar(char c)
{
    write(1, &c, 1);
}

int deal_key(int key, void *param)
{
    ft_putchar('X');
    mlx_pixel_put(mlx_ptr, win_ptr, );
    return (0);
}

int main() 
{
    void *mlx_ptr;
    void *win_ptr;

    mlx_ptr = mlx_init(); // returns a void*, it's just a connection login to the graphical server.
    win_ptr = mlx_new_window(mlx_ptr, 500, 500, "mlx 42");
    mlx_pixel_put(mlx_ptr, win_ptr, 250, 250, 0xFFFFFF);
    mlx_key_hook(win_ptr, deal_key, (void *)0;
    mlx_loop(mlx_ptr);
}

To draw a line you can use: 
- Bresenham's line https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bresenham%27s_line_algorithm (simpler solution) or 
- Xiaolin Wu's line https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiaolin_Wu%27s_line_algorithm (more sophisticated 
solution which will produced more beautiful result).

How do I figure out if my program has a memory leak?
There's a ton of ways to see if your program has memory leaks and one of the easiest ways to do so is 
through the leaks command on all of the lab computers! The easiest way I found to use leaks is to 
simply add an infinite loop at the end of your program and then have another Terminal window open to 
run the leaks command on! 
while(1)
        ;

-Wall	Recommended compiler warnings.
-Werror Make all warnings into errors.
-Wextra This enables some extra warning flags that are not enabled by -Wall.

“events” programming 
Event-driven programming is a programming paradigm in which the flow of the program is determined by events 
such as user actions (mouse clicks, key presses), sensor outputs, or messages from other programs/threads.


mlx_init            To create connection between your software and the display.
mlx_new_window      To create a new window on the screen.
mlx_loop            To receive events.

F-n to parse the data to the program - acquire_xyz (opening the map file, then call the function that reads it into a list of strings (containing the lines)):
1. read_map_to_lst  (reads the lines of the map file and stores them in a linked list)
2. ft_lstdel2   (??? from libft)
3. chr_mtx_3d   (splits the lines acquired into matrix elements of text)
4. lines_are_uniform    (makes sure that the number of values in every line is the same)
5.
6.
7. free_mtx_chr     (???)
8. pts_mtx_3d   (sets the struct of the points with the values that it should have.)
